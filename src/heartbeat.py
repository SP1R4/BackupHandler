"""
heartbeat.py - Dead-man's-switch heartbeat ping.

On a successful backup run, we GET/POST a heartbeat URL (healthchecks.io,
Dead Man's Snitch, Uptime Kuma, etc). The external service expects a ping
on a schedule; a missed ping triggers their alert. That catches the silent
failures our own notifications cannot report — host off, systemd unit
disabled, network partition before the run started.

URL scheme is restricted to http/https to prevent SSRF and file:// leakage,
mirroring webhook_notify's validator.
